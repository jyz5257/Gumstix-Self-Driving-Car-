# Gumstix-Self-Driving-Car
## Project Description
This project is a embededd system course project. The aim of this project is to detect Stop-sign & Yield signs for autonomous motion of the car, which is based on Gumstix board. Using linuxâ€™s inbuilt device drivers, we obtain the image frames, convert them to RGB values, and do thresholding on these pixels to detect red or blue colours. A kernel module on gumstix, then uses flags to determine which GPIO pins to be enabled, and move the car in forward/stop or reverse direction.
