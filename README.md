# Gumstix-Self-Driving-Car
## Project Description
This project is a embededd system course project. The aim of this project is to detect Stop-sign & Yield signs for autonomous motion of the car, which is based on Gumstix board. Using linuxâ€™s inbuilt device drivers, we obtain the image frames, convert them to RGB values, and do thresholding on these pixels to detect red or blue colours. A kernel module on gumstix, then uses flags to determine which GPIO pins to be enabled, and move the car in forward/stop or reverse direction.
## Project Components
* Camera: Logitech Y270 Webcam
* Motor driver: L293D
* Self made mobile car: moter power supply 3V - 6V
* Battery: for moter driver: 9V battery stepped down to 5V using a regulator; for Gumstix: 5V, 1A
## How to run
1. Go to Gumstix kernel
2. Insert the camera modules following these steps:
* insmod v4l2-common.ko
* insmod v4l1-compat.ko
* insmod compat_ioctl32.ko
* insmod videodev.ko
* insmod uvcvideo.ko
3. Unzip km.zip file and go to this folder, and do these steps:
* make clean
* make
4. Transfer motor.ko to gumstix
5. run the command to initialise the device file:
* mknod /dev/motor c 61 0
